# Qualcomm AI Hub Deployment Instructions

This document outlines the steps required to deploy the AI model to the Qualcomm AI Hub and integrate it with the MediBox system.

## Prerequisites

1. **Qualcomm AI Hub Account**: Ensure you have an account on the Qualcomm AI Hub.
2. **Model Code**: The AI model code should be ready and tested locally.
3. **API Access**: Obtain the API access credentials for the Qualcomm AI Hub.

## Model Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare the Model**:
   - Ensure your model is trained and saved in a compatible format (e.g., TensorFlow SavedModel, ONNX).
   - Include any necessary preprocessing and postprocessing scripts.

2. **Create a Deployment Package**:
   - Package your model files and any dependencies into a zip file.
   - Ensure the structure is as follows:
     ```
     model/
     ├── model_file
     ├── requirements.txt
     └── inference_script.py
     ```

3. **Upload the Model**:
   - Log in to the Qualcomm AI Hub.
   - Navigate to the "Model Management" section.
   - Click on "Upload Model" and select your deployment package.
   - Fill in the required metadata (model name, description, etc.).

4. **Set Up Inference Endpoint**:
   - After uploading, create an inference endpoint for your model.
   - Configure the endpoint settings (e.g., input/output formats, authentication).

5. **Test the Endpoint**:
   - Use tools like Postman or curl to send test requests to your inference endpoint.
   - Ensure the model responds correctly with the expected output.

## Integration with Flask Backend

To integrate the AI model with the Flask backend, use the following sample code snippet:

```python
import requests

def call_ai_model(user_data):
    url = "https://<your-ai-hub-endpoint>"
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your-access-token>"
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=user_data, headers=headers)
    return response.json()
```

## Conclusion

Following these steps will allow you to successfully deploy your AI model to the Qualcomm AI Hub and integrate it with the MediBox system for health prediction and adherence analysis. Ensure to monitor the model's performance and update it as necessary.
